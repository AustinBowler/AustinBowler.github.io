                <p>The web site is better in mobile, everything is formatted for mobile use in contrast, proximity, alignment, and contrast. Although you have to expect that from the Dilbert comic strip, it is about software engineers.</p>

                <p> I tried to send a facebook message, but I got confused, so never ended up doing it. Overall very user friendly, but they could make creating content easier.</p>

                <p>It was interesting that Facebook spread a persona of a product rather than a person. This kept users away from developing feelings for a product, and focused on friends and family connecting online.</p>

                <p>It was as hard to use as in desktop, but thatâ€™s as much as you can expect from Yahoo. However, it is the home of the B9 Robot Builders Club! But in all seriousness, the mobile browsing on this site was really more based for desktop, as many of the icons were too small.</p>

                <p>Personas in Yahoo Groups are decribed by group. In the below picture, it describes just the basics of the group, in this case being the B9 Robot Builder's Club. It provides an overview of dates and categories.</p>

                <h2>Visitor Analysis</h2>

                <p>It looked very nice, but a few of the buttons and text ran into each other. The html script was obviously formatted for mobile, but text and buttons were not formatted very well. They most likely used a desktop to mobile converter.</p>

                <h2>Persona</h2>

                <p>I was shocked when I looked at The RPC Studio's web site and found no hint of any persona! Literally, there is no "about" tab, or any information abouth where they are even based. For an online store it seems pretty scary... I, however, have made business with them, throwing caution into the wind and doing something that no normal person would do. This is why persona is important; if you do not have it, nobody buys form you. Unless you are crazy like me.</p>
