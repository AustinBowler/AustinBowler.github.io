				<p id="about">When I first saw the great 1960's television series, Lost in Space, I was about the same age as one of the characters, Will Robinson. My father had gone upstairs to get the VHS tapes and came downstairs with a recording of the episode, "Revolt of the Androids". I was immediately hooked, and watched the episodes as often as possible. I often would build tiny effigies of the beautiful robot out of cardboard boxes, and play with them untill my mother got tired of them and threw them away. I always knew that I would build a full-scale replica one day, and the time has come (my mom won't throw this one away).</p>
