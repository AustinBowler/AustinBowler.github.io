Hello!

You've discovered my newest font WillRobinson.  As in "Danger!  Danger, Will Robinson!"

It's a display face.  There are (in most cases) four versions of each letter.  Some letters vary a little more than others.  Check out your KeyCapsDA to find them all!  Or just try pressing "Option" or "Shift-Option" as you type in your letters.  It was made by the kind folk at De Nada Industries.  I hope you enjoy it.  I am asking for a small shareware fee for this font.  Five Dollars.  That's all!

Why should you want to give me five dollars?

Because it will encourage me to create and release more fonts.  If you like this, you'll like more.

(Actually, I'll create them anyway, I just won't release them without some sort of incentive!)

Send $5 to:
